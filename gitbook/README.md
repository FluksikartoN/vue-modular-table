# Vue modular table documentation

Vue-modular-table is a Vue component, which we built due to the lack of the functionality we needed in the current open source tables for Vue. In Vue-modular-table you will find the class TableDefinition, which will help you define your table plain, clean and will give you the power to modify it.

Vue-modular-table does not use **jQuery** or any other extensive libraries. It works with **Vue2 **and its only dependency is **es5-dot-prop**. It is made to easily work with **Vuex. **The table does not provide built-in CSS, but it provides several ways to add your own styling to it.**  **
